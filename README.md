# NextJS || Redux Toolkit || Redux Persist TypeScript Example

This example shows how to integrate Next.js with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) and [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist).

The **Redux Toolkit** is a standardized way to write Redux logic (create actions and reducers, setup the store with some default middlewares like redux devtools extension). This example demonstrates each of these features with Next.js

> This example builds on [NextJS/Redux example found here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-redux)
